# JS-Gacha-System
A Gacha-like (lootbox) system using JS

Took some of Frieren: Beyond Journey's End character in a list in no particual order to generate a list of available "heroes" (RIP some of the Mages in the Common area).

I've always been curious with how the Gacha system would work in some of the games I've played before, so decided to try implementing my own. Nothing too fancy and I bet it can be improved a lot, but for my purposes this is enough.

Everything is JS, so you can just paste them into the Developer's Console in your browser and test. Feel free to change the hero list too, just beware of the necessary properties for the algorythm to be able to run.

Have fun on your casino!
